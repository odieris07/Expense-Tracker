# Expense-Tracker
I followed this tutorial -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrFnS7YUdiU 
I then applied my knowledge of saving to Local Storage.
I asked assistant from DeepSeek AI to optimize it.
I then made some adjustments to readability for my own.
You can also upload this as a chrome extension since I added a manifest.json file.
